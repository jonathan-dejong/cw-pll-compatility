Adds ability to link a currency from the WooCommerce Currency Switcher plugin with a language in Polylang.

== Description ==

Setup Polylang and WooCommerce Currency Switcher.
Select a currency for each language in Polylang.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Start linking currencies to languages.
